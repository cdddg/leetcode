# [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii)
<span style="color:red">`Hard`</span>

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

    Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
    Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

    Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


**Example 3:**

    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`

**Related Topics:** `array` `dynamic-programming`

Here, the `oneBuy` keeps track of the lowest price, and `oneBuyOneSell` keeps track of the biggest profit we could get.

Then the tricky part comes, how to handle the twoBuy? Suppose in real life, you have bought and sold a stock and made $100 dollar profit. When you want to purchase a stock which costs you $300 dollars, how would you think this? You must think, um, I have made $100 profit, so I think this $300 dollar stock is worth $200 FOR ME since I have hold $100 for free.

There we go, you got the idea how we calculate `twoBuy`!! We just minimize the cost again!! The `twoBuyTwoSell` is just making as much profit as possible.

在這裡，`oneBuy` 跟踪最低價格，而 `oneBuyOneSell` 跟踪我們可以獲得的最大利潤。

那麼棘手的部分來了，如何處理兩個Buy？ 假設在現實生活中，您買賣了一隻股票並獲得了 100 美元的利潤。 當你想購買一隻價值 300 美元的股票時，你會怎麼想？ 你一定認為，嗯，我已經賺了 100 美元，所以我認為這只 300 美元的股票對我來說價值 200 美元，因為我免費持有 100 美元。

好了，你知道我們如何計算 `twoBuy` 了！ 我們只是再次將成本降到最低！！ `twoBuyTwoSell` 只是在賺取盡可能多的利潤。

            s1 = max(s1, p - b1)
            b2 = min(b2, p - s1)
            s2 = max(s2, p - b2)
            
        return s2
