# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii)
<span style="color:orange">`Medium`</span>

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
    Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.


**Example 2:**

    Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Total profit is 4.


**Example 3:**

    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.


**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profix = 0
        for i in range(len(prices) - 1):
            if prices[i] < prices[i + 1]:
                profix += (prices[i + 1] - prices[i])

        return profix
