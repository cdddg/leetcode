# [188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv)
<span style="color:red">`Hard`</span>

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

    Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.


**Example 2:**

    Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.


**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= k <= 100`
  * `0 <= prices.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

**Related Topics:** `array` `dynamic-programming`

## Solutions [^1]:

參考 [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III ](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii) 解法, k = 2 --> k

`dynamic-programming`

Time complextity: `O(kn)` <br>
Space complexity: `O(2n)`

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if k == 0:
            return 0
        elif k >= len(prices) // 2:
            profit = 0
            # spelling.1
            for i in range(1, len(prices)):
                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]):
                    profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            return profit
            # spelling.2
            # return sum(
            #     x - y
            #     for x, y in zip(prices[1:], prices[:-1])
            #     if x > y
            # )

        buys = [float('inf')] * k
        profits = [0] * k
        for p in prices:
            for i in range(k):
                buys[i] = min(buys[i], p if i == 0 else p - profits[i - 1])
                profits[i] = max(profits[i], p - buys[i])

        return profits[-1]
