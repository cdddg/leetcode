# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water)
<span style="color:orange">`Medium`</span>

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

    Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49
    Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.


**Example 2:**

    Input: height = [1,1]
    Output: 1


**Constraints:**

  * `n == height.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

`brute-force`

Time complexity: `O(n^2)`,  TimeLimitExceeded <br>
Space complexity: `O(1)`

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i, n1 in enumerate(height):
            for j, n2 in enumerate(height):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                
                area = min(n1, n2) * abs(j - i)

                if result < area:
                    result = area
                    
        return result

`two-pointers`

單迴圈處理, 每次都進行左右值的計算 然後依序往中間縮, 最後返回最大面積

Time complexity: `O(n)` <br>
Space complexity: `O(1)`

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        area = 0
        while l < r:
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                area = max(area, height[l] * (r - l))
                l += 1
            else:
                area = max(area, height[r] * (r - l))
                r -= 1
            
        return area
```
