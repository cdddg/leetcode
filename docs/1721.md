# [1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list)
You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return _the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the _`kth` _node from the beginning and the_`kth` _node from the end (the list is **1-indexed** )._

 

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/linked1.jpg)

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
    Output: [1,4,3,2,5]


**Example 2:**

    Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
    Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]




**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
  * `1 <= k <= n <= 105`
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
