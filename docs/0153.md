# [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array)
<span style="color:orange">`Medium`</span>

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

  * `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
  * `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.


Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.


**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.


**Example 3:**

    Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
    Output: 11
    Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 


**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 5000`
  * `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
  * All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
  * `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m = nums[0]  # minimum
        while nums:
            i = len(nums) // 2
            v = nums[i]
            if m < v:
                nums = nums[i+1:]
            else:
                nums = nums[:i]
                m = v
                
        return m
```

index (因數列是從小排到大, 所以移動時 index 從右邊往左邊找 找最小值)

Time complextity: `O(logn)` <br>
Space complexity: `O(2)`

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while low < high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2

            if nums[mid] < nums[high]:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1

        return nums[low]
```

### Test

```
assert Solution().findMin([3,4,5,1,2]) == 1
assert Solution().findMin([4,5,6,7,0,1,2]) == 0
assert Solution().findMin([11,13,15,17]) == 11
```
